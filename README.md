# Overwatch

I love overwatch, great game, but there was never a good test to see what character you want, anything like buzzfeed will always
have those one sided questions, such as "do you like making turrets"? This test is different, every character has an exactly equal chance
of being chosen. the way it works is it will ask you a question such as "do you like to be far from the enemy, or close" you then say
far or close, after that you say on a scale of 1-10 how important being far or close from the enemy is. What the system will then do is
look to see what option you chose, lets say you said far, it will look at what characters play far away from the enemy, and it will add
whatever number you said, that way if you said 1, not much will be tallied in to each character that fits that category, but if you said
10 meaning ultra important, then that will be a big decider in the end, so for each question a character appears in a category, every
character will be either "close" to the enemy or "far" it's not going to exclude a character, therfore making the test completly fair to
all characters, at the end the system will look at who got the most points, and tell you so, if you care to see how high each character
tallied you may say "tally" and it will show you every character, neatly divided into their role.
